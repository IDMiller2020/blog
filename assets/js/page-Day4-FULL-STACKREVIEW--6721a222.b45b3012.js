I will be taking it one step at a time and I'm going to try not to let myself get stuck for too long on one issue before I move on to something else and add the problem to the list of things I need to get help with. That's going to be hard for me because I really like to get each part working before moving on to something else, I don't like to leave things broken.\nI would say the thing I enjoyed most about the course so far is the encouragement and patient help I have received throughout the entire course from everyone at BCW. I can't think of a single person at BCW that has ever made me feel bad about not understanding something, or who has not taken the time to help me out and encourage me to keep going.")])])}),[],!1,null,null,null);t.default=r.exports}}]);
